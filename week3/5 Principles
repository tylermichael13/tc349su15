5 Principles
</head>

<h2>
  The site I selected was NewEgg.com
</h2>

<img src="Affordance.png" width="500" alt=""/>
<body>
  This image represents the principle of affordance because as seen to the right of
  "All Products", "Deals and Services", and "Featured Sellers" there is a small downward pointing triangle.
  This affords a set of options that will appear below if clicked.
</body>

<img src="Chunking.png" width="200" alt=""/>
<body>
This image represents chunking because different pieces of information are chunked into
different boxes. One box is for pricing of the selected item, one is for price-matching
from different sites, and one is for recommended products.
</body>

<img src="HicksLaw.png" alt=""/>
<body>
  This image represents Hick's Law because of the organization of the menu.
  It presents a multitude of options, but the first option is the most general by far.
  It groups some of the options together under "Computer Systems", but presents more
  narrow options below.
</body>

<img src="RuleofThirds.png" alt=""/>
<body>
  This image represents the rule of thirds in a couple of ways. In the navigation menu are three
  different options: "All Products", "Deals and Services", and "Featured Sellers".
  At the bottom of the image, we see the rule of thirds again in the three options
  "Shell Shocker", "Daily Deals", and "Spotlight".
</body>

<img src="Signal-to-Noise.png" alt=""/>
<body>
  I chose this image to look at the signal to noise principle. I believe that NewEgg actually
  doesn't do very well with signal to noise, as it is very easy to confuse when they are
  showcasing their deals, and when they are advertising specific products.
